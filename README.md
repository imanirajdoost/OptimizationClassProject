# Optimization Class Project
A project made in Unity for the Unity Optimization Class.

Use the skills you've learnt during the class to optimize this project. The scripts recommended for optimizing is in Scripts/Improvable. You don't need to change other scripts except the ones in this folder, but there are no limitations!

You can optimize any asset you want in the project; Textures, sounds, scripts, 3D objects, etc. Make sure to also organize the project files and hierarchy and delete the unnecassary stuff.


If you're having a hard time finding out what to do, there are tips provided in the scripts in form of comments that will help you out or will reference you to the related video tutorial. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me using my email: imanirajdoost@gmail.com


The project is created using Unity 2020.3.20f and I haven't verified it with other versions of Unity so I recommend you use this version or later.
